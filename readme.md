node-fontlist
==================

This is a node.js module that searches for, and returns a list of fonts installed
on your system. It is intended for use in node-webkit, in case you want to make a
dialog that lets the user choose a font.

The module simply returns an array of strings corresponding to the names of the
font files installed on your system.

Note that this module is still incomplete, and a work in progress.
